Corresponding patterns in different datasets correspond to the same original character. 200 instances per class (for a total of 2,000 instances) have been digitized in binary images.\n\n### Attribute Information  \nThe attributes represent 76 Fourier coefficients of the character shapes.\n\n### Relevant Papers  \nA slightly different version of the database is used in  \nM. van Breukelen, R.P.W.
